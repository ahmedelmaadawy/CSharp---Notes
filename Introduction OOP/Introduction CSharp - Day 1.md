# What Is C# ?
C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and
robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

# Compilation Process

The C# compilation process involves several stages that convert high-level C# code into executable machine code. Hereâ€™s an overview of each stage in the process:
1. Source Code
	You start with the C# source code written in `.cs` files. This code contains your program logic and structure.

2. Compilation
	The C# compiler (csc.exe) compiles the source code into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). The result is a `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library) or `.exe` (Executable) file, known as an assembly.

3. Intermediate Language (IL) Code
	The compiled CIL/IL code is platform-independent. This IL code is stored in the assembly along with metadata that describes the types, members, and references in the code.

4. Common Language Runtime (CLR)
	When you run the C# program, the CLR takes over. The CLR is part of the .NET runtime and is responsible for managing the execution of .NET programs.

5. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation
	The CLR uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to convert the IL code into native machine code specific to the platform on which the program is running. This compilation happens at runtime, just before the code is executed.

6. Execution
	The native machine code generated by the JIT compiler is executed by the CPU. The CLR also provides services such as memory management, garbage collection, and security during the execution of the program.

# Variables
Reference:[Variables Types](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_data_types.php)
**Declaring a Variable**
`datatype Name = Value;`
## 1. Storing Text
```csharp
char letter = 'A';
char digit = '1';
```

```csharp
string firstName = "Ahmed";
```

`For file bath or string as literal We Use @ saymbol because it can make errors in \t ot \n in strings`

```csharp
string filePath =@"C:\tv\folder";
```
### Raw String Literals like XML or HTML
```csharp
string xml = """
		<person age="50">
			<first_name>Mark</first_name>
			</person>
""";
```
### Raw interpolation string literals
In raw string literals curly brackets {} are treated as raw content of the string so need to specify the number of brackets that you want to be treated as string interpolation by the number of $ signs before the literal string

```csharp
var person = new{FirstName ="Salem" ,Age =25 };

string Json = $$"""{
		"firstname":"{{person.FirstName}}",
		"age":{{person.Age}},
		"calculation":"{{{1=2}}}"
}""";
```
Output =>
```json
{
	"firstname":"Salem",
	"age":25,
	"calculation":"{3}" 
}
```
___
## 2. Storing Numbers

```csharp
// unsigned integer for positive numbers or 0
uint naturalNumber = 23 ;
// integer is negative or positive number 
int integerNumber = -26 ;
//float is a single precision floting point number
// the f after the number is a must for compiler
float realNumber = 2.3f;
//double is a double precision floating point number
double doubleNumber = 2.3;

```
### Whole Numbers 
- decimal notation is `_`
- binary notation is `0b`
- hexadecimal notation is `0X`

```csharp
int decimalNotation = 2_000_000;
int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_1000_0100_1000_000;
int hexadecimalNotation = 0X_001E_8480;
//check if they have the same values
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation==binaryNotation}");
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation==hexadecimalNotation}");
//Output in decimal
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:N0}");
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:N0}");
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:N0}");
//output in hexcadecimal
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:X}");
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:X}");
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:X}");
```
### Output 

```shell
True
True
2,000,000
2,000,000
2,000,000
1E8480
1E8480
1E8480
```
___
## 3.Storing Boolean
```csharp
bool happy = true;
bool sad = false ;
```

### Nullable Variables
In C#, the compiler does not allow you to assign a null value to a variable, but we can explicitly define if a value type can  hold a null value. 

`int x = null; //=>Error`
`int x? = null ;//No Error`

```c#
int? n = null;

//int m1 = n;    // Doesn't compile
int n2 = (int)n; // Compiles, but throws an exception if n is null
```
